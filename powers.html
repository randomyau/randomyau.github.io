							<p>Deadpool has a plethora of abilities, the most famous one being a superhuman healing factor. Contrary to popular belief, it is not superior to that of Wolverine's, but instead derived from it. Deadpool's healing factor is the same as Wolverine's having it genetically put in him to save him from death of cancer. Deadpool has killed Wolverine, but not by outmatching Wolverine's skills and power. He did this by cheating with a carbonadium blade. Carbonadium is highly radioactive and objects composed of it have proven to slow accelerated healing factors such as Wolverine's, allowing Deadpool to kill him swiftly. Due to the presence of this superhuman healing ability, many of Deadpool's natural physical attributes have been enhanced. Deadpool's musculature generates considerably less fatigue toxins than the muscles of an ordinary human being, granting him superhuman levels of stamina in all physical activities. His natural strength, agility and reflexes have been enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural limits of the human body. Deadpool's agility and reaction time are superior to those of even the finest human athlete.</p>
							<p>Deadpool is an extraordinary hand-to-hand combatant and is skilled in multiple unarmed combat techniques. He is a master of assassination techniques, is an excellent marksman, and is highly skilled with bladed weapons (frequently carrying two swords strapped to his back). He is fluent in Japanese, German, Spanish, amongst other languages.</p>
							<p>Another one considered to be one of his abilities is breaking the fourth wall, with includes speaking to the reader, mentioning being part of a bigger universe and that they are just puppets, and jumping into other universes to kill characters in classic novels and such. Also, if it's your concern, I'm suspicious that he has a power of making the eyes on his mask move to show expression. It's just mind-twisting! Look at this!
