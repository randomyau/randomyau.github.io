							<p>Hi, it's Deadpool again. If you didn't know, recently I came out with a movie starring God's perfect idiot, a moody teen, and a British villain, directed by an overpaid tool. Because you don't need to know the exact specifics of this beautiful love story's plot, let's dive straight into the easter eggs. As funny as I am, you know there's bound to be some blatant and some subtle and obscure references. In the opening title scene, you are presented with an amazing slow motion scene of me fighting the bad guys. Suddenly, a dude's wallet pops into the shot, and a Green Lantern card is shown to the audience, floating around in slow motion. Green Lantern is that stupidly played role by my actor, Ryan Reynolds. He totally redeemed himself by nailing this role. Moving on, there are two references as to Ryan's past role as Deadpool (not me, obviously, that other Deadpool is so stupid), in the form of a figure of it that Ryan picks up, and one other time when Ajax tells me I should have my mouth sewn shut. But to aboid any other spoilers, I'm gonna have to leave the rest to you when you watch my movie, that earned over 600 million dollars, by the way. Haha. Subtle brag.</p>
