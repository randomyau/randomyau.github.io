							<p>Wade Wilson was an ordinary mercenary who lost his mom in early childhood. His dad was physically abusive and gave him a rough time. But we're here to talk about how he became Deadpool, so let's skip the 'physically abused as a child' section. Deadpool was diagnosed with cancer, blah blah blah...was going to die, blah. BUT, one day, Wade was confronted by an agent of Department K, a secret military base in Canada dedicated to researching mutants and said. Then, he was given powers, including Wolverine's superhuman healing factor. Because SOMEHOW they had a bottle of that lying around. Also, his agility, strength, et cetera, was enhanced. Also, he had the ability to break the fourth wall. Now, you as the reader, might be wondering, "What is it you have to do to break the fourth wall?", and my fellow reader, I will tell you, just do what I'm doing right now. MOVING ON, Deadpool became a test subject, instead of his crushed dream of becoming a superhero. THEY DID NOT EXTRACT HIS MUTANT POWER BY TORTURING HIM. *cough cough*movie*cough* Instead, they tortured him just because they could. They met Doctor Killebrew and his sadistic assistant, Ajax. From there, Patients would place bets in a "deadpool" as to how long each subject would live. Killebrew subjected Wilson to various torturous experiments for his own deranged satisfaction. But he broke out and blah blah blah, and then, he became the adventure-loving and criminal-fighting Deadpool!</p>
