							Hey guys, welcome to my video game. If you play it (there, is no 'if', you WILL play it), you better make me look good. It's not like we have infinite lives or anything. Oh wait. I can't die! Whatever. A brief synopsis. Starring my usual fourth-wall breaking self and Nolan North, my voice actor. I'd say he did a fair job.

If you didn't get that, you're stupid because I told you to go play it in the beginning of this paragraph.</p>
